  "summary": "Diff adds a new Motoko backend with authorization/user-profile models plus sermon/contact data structures, and a new React/TanStack Router frontend with navigation, typography/theme styling, sermon list item UI, scripture quote component, and a contact form. Several BuildRequest requirements are only partially evidenced in the diff summary; a few implemented features appear unrequested and/or conflict with constraints.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-10",
      "requirement": "Provide initial seed data so the Sermons page renders meaningful content on first load (at least 3 seed sermon entries after deployment).",
      "reason": "Only one seed sermon is shown being added, and it is placed in `postupgrade`, which would not run on a fresh install; the diff summary does not show at least 3 deterministic seed sermons available after initial deployment.",

        "backend/main.mo"

      "id": "REQ-14",
      "requirement": "Generated images are present under `frontend/public/assets/generated` and used in at least the Home and Worship With Us pages.",
      "reason": "No generated image files or references to `frontend/public/assets/generated` are shown in the diff summary; therefore this requirement is not evidenced as implemented.",

      "description": "Internet Identity authentication integration (AuthClient/provider hook) and identity-based actor creation.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest explicitly constrains \"No third-party authentication providers\"; adding Internet Identity auth is not requested and appears to violate the constraint.",

        "frontend/src/hooks/useActor.ts"
      ]
    },
    {
      "description": "User profile data model and APIs (get/save user profile) with role-based authorization.",
      "reason": "Not requested; BuildRequest non-goals exclude a full admin CMS, and no requirements mention user accounts/profiles.",
      "evidence": [
        "backend/main.mo"
      ]
    },
    {
      "description": "Footer includes an outbound link with UTM tracking parameters to caffeine.ai.",
      "reason": "Not requested; acceptance criteria for Resources mentions safe outbound links and no inline tracking. While this is in the footer (not Resources), it still introduces tracking-style parameters and promotional content that is outside the requested church-site scope.",
